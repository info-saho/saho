    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Position Overview:</h2>
      <p>We are seeking a <strong>U.S.-based</strong> spiritual practitioner with <strong>profound knowledge of Hinduism</strong>, <strong>chakra systems</strong>, <strong>breathwork techniques</strong>, and <strong>advanced yogic disciplines</strong>. The ideal candidate should also be well-versed in the principles of <strong>Kriya Shakti</strong> (manifestation through thought-energy) and <strong>the use of crystals for healing and energy work</strong>. This is a <strong>hands-on, in-person</strong> role involving <strong>individual spiritual instruction</strong>, <strong>yoga posture correction</strong>, and <strong>frequent travel across the United States</strong>.One of the core components of this role is <strong>Energy sensing</strong>, which necessitates physical presence to accurately perceive and guide an individual's energetic state. In addition, the practitioner must possess in-depth knowledge of <strong>Vastu </strong> and the ability to correct Vastu imbalances through energetic alignment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Key Responsibilities:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide individualized spiritual instruction grounded in the teachings of Hinduism</li>
        <li>Conduct energy sensing sessions that require physical presence to accurately assess and guide the energetic state of individuals.</li>
        <li>Apply in-depth knowledge of Vastu to identify and address Vastu-related imbalances through energetic balancing techniques.</li>
        <li>Correct and fine-tune yoga postures during in-person sessions</li>
        <li>Teach Pranayama, Turtle Breathing, and other advanced breathwork practices</li>
        <li>Conduct chakra assessments and facilitate energy alignment practices</li>
        <li>Travel across the United States based on program and client needs</li>
        <li>Contribute to the development of programs focused on spiritual healing and transformation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <p>Energy sensing is a core aspect of this role. It includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sensing aura disturbances and chakra blockages through physical proximity</li>
        <li>Reading non-verbal signals, breath patterns, and subtle energetic cues</li>

        <li>Establishing an energetic resonance that facilitates deep healing and trust</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>These elements cannot be effectively delivered through digital platforms</strong>. True transformation in energy and consciousness requires presence, connection, and shared space.</p>

						<h2><i>The Symbolism of Firewood in Gurukula Tradition</i></h2>
					</header>
					<p><i>In ancient Hindu tradition, education was not confined to classrooms or textbooks. It was a
							sacred journey of transformation, discipline, and humility, often undertaken in a gurukula—a
							forest ashram where students lived with their guru. One of the most symbolic acts in this
							tradition was the offering of firewood (samidha) when a student approached a guru for
							learning. This simple act carried profound spiritual meaning and continues to inspire
							seekers even today.
						</i></p>

					<p><i>The firewood offering symbolized the student’s ignorance and ego, presented to the guru to be
							burnt away in the fire of knowledge. The student approached with a humble heart,
							acknowledging their need for wisdom and guidance. Just as dry wood is consumed to produce
							light and warmth, the guru’s teachings were meant to consume inner darkness and illuminate
							the path ahead.

						</i></p>

					<p><i>What makes this tradition especially powerful is that it was observed not just by ordinary
							students, but by divine beings themselves. A well-known example is the story of Lord Krishna
							and his brother Balarama, who, despite their divine nature, followed the path of traditional
							learning under Sage Sandipani. When they reached the guru’s ashram, they did so carrying
							bundles of firewood on their shoulders—no different from any other student....</i></p>

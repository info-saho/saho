						<h2><i>The Symbolism of Super Brain Yoga in Ganesha Worship</i></h2>
					</header>
					<p><i>Whenever we visit temples, especially in front of Lord Ganapathy (Ganesha), we often see
							devotees performing a gesture where they cross their arms, hold their earlobes, and perform
							squats — a practice known as Dhorbi Karanam or Thoppukaranam in Tamil. While traditionally
							seen as an act of devotion and humility, this practice has also gained attention in modern
							science. Referred to as "Super Brain Yoga," it is believed to activate specific acupuncture
							points on the earlobes that stimulate neural pathways, enhance concentration, and improve
							brain abilities. This aligns with the work of neurologist Dr. Paul Nogier, who found that
							the ear resembles an inverted fetus and corresponds to various parts of the body, including
							the brain.</i></p>

					<p><i>As you may know, in Hinduism, ancient rishis often conveyed deeper concepts through symbolic
							representations, adding layers of meaning and beauty to spiritual practices. In the case of
							Super Brain Yoga, the act of stimulating brain function through this simple exercise is
							symbolically represented by Lord Ganesha's large elephant head — a powerful emblem of
							wisdom, intelligence, and mental clarity. Thus, the ritual not only serves a scientific
							purpose but also beautifully reflects the symbolic essence of Ganesha himself.</i></p>

					<p><i>Did you know that most of us perform it incorrectly — with wrong finger placement, arm
							position, or facing the wrong direction? Curious to learn the right way to do Super Brain
							Yoga and unlock the wisdom symbolized by Lord Ganesha’s mighty elephant head?</i></p>

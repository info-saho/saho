					<p><i>Let’s understand where we are today with Hinduism and its practices through a simple
							story.</i></p>

					<p><i>Once, in a peaceful monastery, a teacher and his students used to meditate every evening. But
							there was a cat that kept making noise and distracting everyone. So the teacher decided to
							tie the cat up before meditation. It worked—everyone could focus better. Over time, tying
							the cat became a daily ritual. Years passed. The teacher died, the students left, and even
							the cat passed away. But new students came—and guess what? They brought in a new cat just so
							they could tie it up before meditation, without ever asking why it was done!</i></p>

					<p><i>This is where many of us are today—following rituals without understanding their deeper
							meaning. It's time to look beyond habits and uncover the true wisdom behind the
							practices!</i></p>
